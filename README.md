### Hi there 

Engineering manager/director at a company whose 
mission it is to help the planet survive the [anthropecene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene).

These days I mostly code for fun.

My day job:

- help developers [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))
- enhance society through delivering [software](https://www.royalhaskoningdhv.com/en/challenges/digital-transformation/digital-twins) with my teams
- apply common-sense to uncommon problems
